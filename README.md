# Google-drive-image-submitter

This is a short google script and preliminary website that allows users to submit images into a google drive folder from a website. Initially constructed as way of getting students to anonymously submit difficult questions they encountered without the hassle of filling out a google form, this script was used by over 160 students to submit over 350 questions back when it was deployed in 2022.
